# URL Shortening Service
The web application is a basic url-shortening service. It has a basic form that consists of 1 text input
field and 1 submit button. The text input field will be used for “destination url” which will basically be the long url that will be shortened.
Below the input field, there should be a simple table showing the latest created urls on the system.
